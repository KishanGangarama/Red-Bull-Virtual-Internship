# Red-Bull-Virtual-Internship
In this project, we utilize Excel to preprocess the data, which includes specifics about on-premise accounts, the kinds of marketing and promotions that were implemented, and product lines.
After this step, we visualize the data and collect the necessary information about how sales can be improved, how specific accounts are performing, how the sales of the worst-performing accounts can be improved by comparing them to the best-performing accounts, searching for product lines that have a positive impact on sales, and calculating CAGR to check sales growth of each and every account and account type.
After visualizing the data and gathering knowledge, we produce a powerpoint presentation to properly explain the facts so that essential strategies can be put into place to increase overall sales while concentrating on specific least performing customers.

# Problem Statement: 
# One of your accounts Bar 7 isn't performing well
Your account data analysis showed that one of your accounts from task 1, Bar 7, owned by Lorena Posacco, had robust sales of Red Bull products a few years ago. However, in the last three years, Bar 7’s sales have dropped dramatically. 

You also learned from your data analysis that Bar 7 does not have many marketing and promotion programs implemented, nor a wide product assortment. You have recently been given account management responsibility for the Bar 7 account, and you met with Lorena to introduce yourself and start a dialog about Red Bull sales in her bar.

During that initial meeting, you practiced active listening and made notes about Lorena’s concerns and objections. 

She had two principal concerns:

“Red Bull is quite expensive compared to other energy drinks.”
“Customers don’t ask for Red Bull in my bar.”

# How the problem was approached:
Hello, Lorena! It's Kishan here, following up after our initial meeting. I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to address the objections 
you raised and share some additional thoughts as we consider moving forward together.

I understand that profitability is crucial, and I want to assure you that our products have the potential for higher margins compared to our competitors. 
We have seen this trend with other customers, where they experienced greater profitability by featuring our products prominently.

The reputation and perception of your establishment are of utmost importance. Our products are known for their high quality and popularity. 
By featuring our brand, like Red Bull, prominently in your bar, we have observed considerable uplift compared to competing products. It not only enhances the overall 
image of your bar but also attracts more customers who are looking for quality and trending beverages.

Now, I understand you had reservations about the effectiveness of point-of-sale promotion. Energy drinks, as you know, are part of one of the fastest-growing product 
categories. Our experience shows that point-of-sale promotion works exceptionally well in this industry. Bars that have implemented effective promotion programs have 
witnessed significant sales growth. Additionally, we have observed the success of menu inclusion in driving sales across all types of accounts. For bars specifically, 
implementing most promotion programs have proven to be highly effective. I would love to explore opportunities to expand these programs in your establishment and 
customize them to suit your unique needs.

The bars have traditionally been the largest source of sales. Our data suggests that offering incentives to stock a wider assortment of our products might lead to 
even greater sales in your establishment. I propose a test program to evaluate this correlation and provide you with tangible results to make an informed decision.

Lorena, I want you to know that our goal is to establish a long-term partnership with you, one that is mutually beneficial and aligned with your business objectives. 
I understand that you may have reservations or disagreements with some of the points I've mentioned. I value your perspective, and I'm here to listen and address any 
concerns you may have. Let's have a productive discussion in our next meeting, so that we can further explore these ideas and find the best path forward for your bar.

Thank you for your time, Lorena. I look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a great day!
